- What were some of the challenges you encountered?
    I ran into the problem where react was complaining that i did not define a function correctly in each component multiple times.
    React uses a lot more tools compared to vanilla js to ouput on to the website and was confusing at times.
    I also ran into problems deploying my site.
    I created a new react project from scrached and tried both netlify and github pages but both would only deploy a blank page when uploading my public folder


- Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM. List out a few differences.
    1) Using a virtual dom allows websites to deblpy and make change much more efficientlly though reusable components by only updating certain parts of the dom.
    2) A real dom would load slower but easier for the website to be indexed and it can be directly manipulated with JS since the HTML elemnts are visible in the dom.

- What are some problems that React can solve for us?
    When working as a team react will be much easier to manage mergeing and fixing certain components of the program rather than re running the entire website.
    Updating the dom is much simpler when certain components fail.
    When working with a larger project scale you will only be managing each component rather than a long line of code also making it much more efficient.
